1. THE
Minute Mathematician, &c.
I Freely own to you, when I ſat
down to write my defenſe of
Sir Iſaac Newton and the Britiſh
MathemaII. Your ſecond ſection teaches us, that
things obſcure are not therefore ſacred; and
that it is no

of men who reject that VERY THING in Religion
which they aIV. I do not aſk, Why you choſe to defame
Mathematicians in the month of March,Ann. Dom. 1734, ratheV. Here I would obſerve, that whoever
admires Fluxions, muſt admire them for
ſomething of excellenceVI. More ſecret hiſtory and declamation,
partly about what no body denies, and partly
about what no VII. The chief purport of this ſection
ſeems to be to ſtrengthen the proof you had
before given of tVIII, IX, X. In theſe three ſections I
meet with nothing but declamation. The
ſubject of it is my paXI. You ſay, you heartily abhor an Inquiſition
in Faith. Upon my word you have a
great deal of reaſoXII. More declamation about my declaiming,
and your own Modeſty, and the compliment
you pay to Sir IXIII, XIV, XV, XVI. You tell me, The
adoration that I pay to Sir Iſaac Newton,
you will pay only to XVII. You begin this ſection with addreſſing
your ſelf to me in the following
manner. "I have ſaid (XVIII. I am not of your opinion, that
every reader of common ſenſe may judge as well
of the principlXIX. I will venture to ſay that you have
taken as much pains as (I ſincerely believe)
any man livingXX. I find by this Section as well as by
the eighteenth, that you are perfectly well

acquainted witXXI. The Picture you here draw is really
a very ingenious portraiture, but it has no
manner of reſemXXII. A new way of paſſing over a thing
is never to have done with it. The reader
will eaſily judge XXIII. In the fourth ſection of the Analyſt,
inſtead of fairly giving Sir Iſaac
Newton's plain, eaſyXXIV, XXV, XXVI. I do not remember
to have met with a greater inſtance of
diſtingenuity and wilful mXXVII. Now, gentle Reader, we come
to the point. You are to be ſhown the firſt
inſtance of my couragXXVIII. You tell me, I would fain perplex
this plain caſe by diſtinguiſhing between anincrement and XXIX. You are pleaſed to take notice
that I very candidly repreſent my caſe to be that
of an Aſs betXXX. You intreat me, in the name of Truth,
to tell what this moment is, which is acquired,
which is XXXI. It is now ſo evident even to your
ſelf, that the moment of the rectangle AB
is not the incremeXXXII. Before I proceed to vindicate
that aſſertion of mine which makes the ſubject
of this ſection,

for obtaining a rule to find the fluxion of any
power of a flowingXXXV. You miſtake me, Sir: What I
diſlike in you is not your modeſty, but your
arrogance. 'Tis your XXXVI. I flatter my ſelf, I have already
done to your mind what you here requeſt.XXXVII. If I were to ſay, there are a
hundred mean and low artifices in a certain
pamphlet, ſcarce aXXXVIII. In this Section you addreſs
yourſelf to me in the following words.
"You will have it, that XXXIX. As you do not perſiſt, nay, on
the contrary, deſiſt, and entirely diſown your
accuſing Sir IſXL. I have nothing to ſay to the principles
of the Marquis de l'Hoſpital, I defend
nothing but his rXLI. To all this declamation I ſhall need
to give no other reply, than one you furniſh
me with, p. 2XLII. Empty, childiſh declamation.XLIII. The ſame, or ſomething worſe.

done, to fix upon twXLIV. If you have met with all theſe different

now to the point of Metaphyſicks in diſpute

the Reader to reflect upon and examine by my
light, when you L. As theſe Queries are not propoſed to
